# Hedging-Model
A system that reads in time series data, uses Ordinary Least Squares matrices to create a proposed set of portfolios for hedging using a few different time splits, then uses train/test splitting to verify the most optimal portfolio of assets and their corresponding weights.

To run the code, make sure all 8 of the timeseries data sets are in the correct corresponding data file, and that the read in classes have the right file location at the top of TimeSeries.py (labeled 'DATA ='). These two files have multiple sets of intricate hierarchies, so I would recommend running the TimeSeries file on its own to make sure there are no error, and then run best_regression. The out put should be the prints that are using different portions of the timeseries data to create the optimal portfolio. The most important output would be from 'b.best_regression_backtest(4, datetime(2001, 1, 1)))' that should output the split train/test results of backtest, which have a standard deviation measurement, and then the weights of the assets in the portfolio:
